# Project-GC
Here I will be updating my progress.

# First delivery
# Description
My idea for this project is to create something like a museum in the dark
So, in the middle there will be a museum shelf, a light above and an object
inside the shelf. I haven't decided yet if I want it to be a mario bros star
or a triforce from Zelda.

#Result
I did my project using WebGL with Three.Js, adding a super mario star that I made on blender with its own texture,
also I used a geometry form included in Three.Js and added texture to create a mistery box from super mario too.

# Tech used
I used React for the fron-end wit Vite
